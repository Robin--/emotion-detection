# emotion-detection
Playing around with React Native in order to record camera feed and pass it to Emotion Recognition APIs.

## Setup
 1. Get the code
 2. `npm install`
 3. You need to install Android SDK and have `ANDROID_HOME` set in the path. Check [this thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19986214/setting-android-home-enviromental-variable-on-mac-os-x) to see how.
 3. Edit the `js/api-key.js` file with your Microsoft Cognitive Service API key.
 4. Connect your Android device and do a `react-native run-android` (preferably open another terminal tab and check the logs `react-native log-android`)
